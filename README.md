# Mage

Mage is an Windows defender bypass which requires Admin Permissions. I also got an UAC Bypass which uses a simple Exploit to gain Admin permissions without any user interaction. Maybe i will drop this exploit here later on. Mage uses the exclusion command to whitelist your payload. It will be excluded, dropped on the system and executed. 

Download URL for you payload, final filename, dev mode (test simple anti Sandbox functions), fake error message can be configured in the Option section (Line 17-21). 

[!] Its not fully hidden as of now and you can still improve Mage on your own.

[i] Use Visual Studio 2022 to compile.
